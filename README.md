# freeyorubadictionary
Fyd, short for Free Yoruba Dictionary, is a web app created by a native Yoruba speaker to offer a comprehensive collection of Yoruba words, pronunciations, and meanings.

This is a demo version.

## What's next?
Expect milestone updates as more words are added. 

Future updates will include definitions in languages other than English, words from various Yoruba dialects, and images to illustrate foods and other items.

Currently, the app features words in "Yoruba Ajulomo," the commonly spoken form.

## Backstory
Fyd started as a fun excuse to use my mic, code with AI and give back to the universe of free resources. I love languages so it only made sense that my first official dev project was this. 

Enjoy :)

## Bigger Picture
Fyd is only an atom of a big matter that aims to make Nigerian languages accessible and free for all to learn. Could creating an extensive library for lessons, dictionaries and practice materials for over 500 Nigerian langugages make a social impact? I guess you (hello future teammate) and I are about to find out.
